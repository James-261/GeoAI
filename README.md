# GeoAI

GeoAI is a project made for quickly downloading panoramas from co-ordinates and sorting based on inference detections

## Installation

Clone repo and run install.py

## Usage

Generate locations with https://map-generator.vercel.app/ and download as csv, this will be your locs file

You will need to train your own weights for the thing you are trying to detect
Roboflow has a well written blog of how to start
